    Code cleanup
    Everything around git, README etc.
    Set everything up for Appstore
    Code review
    Implement real ads

    *Future ideas:*
    XCode errors, Google Ads SDK needs to get an update
    Google play store
    App Icons (Need to add for android)
    Test on android
    Revive Animation
    Unlock skin animation
    Remake Widget methods to classes for performance increase
    Highscore animation circle remove? Fade out in the corners to remove the circle
    Frame cap to lower power consumption?
    Responsive UI, looks bad but can be improved if people actually play the game

    // Requires backend

    *Store*
    Add logging for errors and crashes
    Get big highscore to unlock skins
    Unlock different backgrounds
    Notifications for new stuff in store
    In app purchase
